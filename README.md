This represents a contract for a VCG (vickery-clark-groves) auction.

The contract runs one auction at a time. 

Each auction is instantiated with a fixed number of bidders. Once the target number of bidders has been satisfied, the auction may be closed and a winner selected. 

Authorizing bidders based on predetermined addresses will be a necessary but later feature of this contract.
